# nom

**nom** is a command line tool that helps you lose weight by tracking your energy intake and creating a negative feedback loop. It's inspired by John Walker's [The Hacker's Diet](https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/) and tries to automate things as much as possible.

## Installation

You'll need Ruby, Rubygems and gnuplot. On Windows, make sure that gnuplot's binary directory is added to your `PATH` during installation.

Then run this command:

    $ gem install nom

When you run `nom` for the first time, it will ask for your current and your desired weight.

## Usage

Call `nom` without arguments to get a summary of your current status:

    $ nom
    5.3 kg down (34%), 10.3 kg to go!

    Today: (1774)

       (200) Griespudding
       (110) Graubrot
       (125) KÃ¤se
        (87) Orangensaft
    ---------------------
      (1252) remaining

You ate/drank something? Look up at FDDB how much energy it contained. (The search is German only for now, sorry.)

    $ nom Mate
    Club Mate (Brauerei Loscher)
        (40) 1 Glas (200 ml)
        (66) 1 kleine Flasche (330 ml)
        (100) 1 Flasche (500 ml)
    Mate Tee, Figurfit (Bad Heilbrunner)

Report your energy intake:

    $ nom Club-Mate 100

Enter your weight regularly:

    $ nom 78.2

And get nice graphs. The upper graph shows weight over time, with a weighted (no pun intended) moving average, a weight prediction, and a green finish line. The lower graph shows daily energy intake targets and actual intake:

    $ nom plot

Enter `nom help` if you're lost:

    There are some useful defaults:
          (no arguments)              status
          <number>                    weight <number>
          <term>                      search <term>
          <term> <number>             nom <term> <number>
    Configuration options (put these in /home/seb/.nom/config):
          rate                        How much weight you want to lose per week (default: '0.5')
          goal                        Your target weight
          image_viewer                Your preferred svg viewer, for example 'eog -f', 'firefox', 'chromium' (default: 'xdg-open')
          unit                        Your desired base unit in kcal (default: '1')
          start_date                  The first day that should be considered by nom [yyyy-mm-dd]
          balance_start               The day from which on nom should keep track of a energy balance [yyyy-mm-dd]

## Conventions

*nom* looks for its configuration directory in `~/.local/share/nom`, or `~/.nom/` (in that order),
and operates on three files in that configuration directory:
* `config` contains configuration settings
* `input` contains stuff you ate
* `weight` contains weight measurements.
The files are plain text, you can edit them by hand.

By default, energy quantities will have the unit "kcal". You can change this by adding a line like `unit: 0.239` to your `config`, which means you want to use the unit "0.239 kcal" (= "1 kJ"). Energy quantities are displayed in parentheses: `(42)`

Weight quantities are displayed as "kg", but you can use arbitrary units, like pounds.
